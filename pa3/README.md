## Due Dates:

Early turn-in: September 28, 11:59 PM
Hard turn-in: October 1, 11:59 PM

## Getting started

For this assignment, you'll need Node again. Install packages with `npm install`.

## Assignments

You will implement a lazy-evaluation system in JavaScript (lazy.js).  
As before, we have removed the solutions and
included an opening and closing comment `/** <FILL-IN> **/` where you are
expected to fill in your answers.  You may not add code anywhere outside these
comment blocks.

### Testing your solution

You can run the code by calling Node:

For example:

```bash
node lazy.js
```

Test the code with: 
```bash
node test.js
```

#### No-nos

In all cases we are exporting the answers (e.g., `exports.fold_left = ...`),
please do not remove any of this code. If we can't test your code, you lose
points.

#### Grading

We have included the points-worth of each question in the comments.
The maximum score is 35 points.

#### Submission

You must submit the assignment via gradescope. 
Submit your assignment by uploading the following files only:

- lazy.js

Unlike our first assignments, the autograder will not look for your files or
otherwise fix your bugs. You may only upload these files and you must ensure
they can be loaded.
